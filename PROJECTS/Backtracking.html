    <h1>Backtracking</h1>
    <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion.</p><br>
    <br>
    <p>The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options, and you must choose one of these. After you make your<br> 
       choice you will get a new set of options; just what set of options you get depends on what choice you made. This procedure is<br>
       repeated over and over until you reach a final state. If you made a good sequence of choices, your final state is a goal state; if<br>
       you didn't, it isn't.</p>
